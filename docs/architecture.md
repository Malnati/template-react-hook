# Architecture Documentation

This document provides an overview of the project's architecture, including its components, data flow, and design principles.

## Overview
The project is designed with modularity and scalability in mind. Below is a high-level representation of the system architecture:

1. **Frontend**: The user interface, built using [specify framework or language].
2. **Backend**: Handles the business logic, APIs, and database interactions.
3. **Database**: Stores all persistent data.

## Components
### Frontend
- **Description**: The frontend is responsible for delivering a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Technologies**: [e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular].

### Backend
- **Description**: The backend provides RESTful APIs for the frontend and handles authentication, data processing, and other business logic.
- **Technologies**: [e.g., Node.js, Java, Python].

### Database
- **Description**: The database layer manages data storage and retrieval.
- **Technologies**: [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL].

## Data Flow
1. **User Interaction**: The user interacts with the frontend via a web or mobile application.
2. **API Requests**: The frontend sends API requests to the backend.
3. **Data Processing**: The backend processes the requests and interacts with the database if necessary.
4. **Response**: The backend sends the processed data back to the frontend for display.

## Design Principles
- **Modularity**: Components are separated into independent, interchangeable modules.
- **Scalability**: The system can handle increased user loads by scaling horizontally or vertically.
- **Maintainability**: The codebase is structured to allow easy updates and debugging.

## Diagrams
Add diagrams to provide a visual representation of the architecture. Example tools include [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) or [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/).
